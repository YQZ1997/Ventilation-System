# Ventilation-System
The project mainly includes three parts: the fresh air system host, the fresh air system controller and the mobile phone mini program. The fresh air system host realizes the control of the AC fan speed through the solid state relay by receiving the instructions of the fresh air system controller. The fresh air system controller reads the data of the PM2.5 sensor through UART communication, reads the temperature and humidity sensor data through I2C communication, generates the control instructions for the host according to the indoor environment data read, and completes the communication with the host through the LORA module to achieve control of the host. At the same time, the monitored environmental data is sent to the mobile phone through esp8266, and the user can monitor the environmental situation and realize the control of the fan on the mobile phone.
